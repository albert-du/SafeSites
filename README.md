# SafeSites

SafeSites is a website designed to help protect vulnerable users online by identifying the amount of hateful content and malicious content on a website. Our mission is to help those who do not have access to premium websites by ensuring that the free websites they use are beneficial and safe for them to browse as well as give more equal access to safe websites.

We noticed a problem with the amount of racial and malicious statements made online that are targeted toward minority groups. This hinders the amount of growth that these minority groups are able to get because of their fear of going on the internet and risking exposure to hateful, targeted statements. We aim to support them as they now can browse the internet safely and gain access to safe websites like everyone else.

Additionally, many educational institutions pay for software to block websites with hateful and explicit content. This is something that only higher-end schools can do. Our goal is to improve access to safe sites for all educational institutions so that students can learn and grow in a safe environment.

The internet is a vital source of information and entertainment in today's digital world. However, many users are exposed to harmful content, such as hate speech, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being. SafeSites aims to counter this problem by analyzing websites and providing users with information on the potential harm they may cause.
<br><br>
Our platform utilizes cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence-driven image recognition and a hate speech detection AI model to detect the amount of harmful and detrimental content on a website. SafeSites is user-friendly and has an easy-to-understand rating system that assesses a website's safety. By using SafeSites, users can make informed decisions about the websites they choose to visit and avoid potentially harmful content.

In the future, we would love to add keyword searches that we will be able to detect on the website that the user will provide us. This will help the community of people who have suffered through life-changing trauma. This will allow them to browse the internet safely and gain more equal access. Our current backend supports the capability of data caching to improve the time it would take for the server to generate a response; it is also capable of horizontal scaling to support future users and developments.
<br><br>
Our team is committed to making the internet a safer place for everyone. We believe that access to safe and reliable online resources is a basic human right, and we are dedicated to ensuring that those who are less fortunate have equal access to safe websites.
<br><br>
In summary, Safesites is a website designed to protect vulnerable users online by identifying and reporting how much hateful content a website has. Our mission is to assist in the educational process and give more equal access to safe websites on the internet to minority groups.
